</details>



- **loops** - for, while, do-while loops, break, continue, nested loops

<details>
<summary>Loops Guide</summary>

### LOOP SELECTION GUIDELINES:
- Use FOR loops when you know the number of iterations
- Use WHILE loops when condition-based looping is needed
- Use DO-WHILE loops when you need at least one execution

### PERFORMANCE NOTES:
- Minimize work inside loops
- Consider loop unrolling for performance-critical code
- Be careful with nested loops - complexity grows quickly

### COMMON PITFALLS:
- Off-by-one errors (< vs <=, starting from 0 vs 1)
- Infinite loops (forgetting to update loop variable)
- Modifying loop variable inside the loop body unexpectedly
- Using break/continue in wrong contexts
- Nested loop confusion with break/continue

</details>

- **functions-basics** - Function declaration, definition, parameters, return values, scope

<details>
<summary>Functions</summary>

 ### FUNCTION BEST PRACTICES:
 - Keep functions small and focused on single task
 - Use meaningful function and parameter names
 - Always declare function prototypes
 - Handle error conditions appropriately
 - Minimize use of global variables
 - Document complex functions
  
 ### SCOPE RULES:
 - Local variables: Accessible only within the function
 - Global variables: Accessible from any function
 - Function parameters: Local to the function
 - Static variables: Retain values between function calls
  
 ### PARAMETER PASSING:
 - Pass by value: Function receives copy of variable
  - Pass by reference: Function receives address of variable (using pointers)
 
 ### COMMON PITFALLS:
 - Forgetting to declare function prototypes
 - Confusion between local and global variables
 - Not handling edge cases in functions
 - Infinite recursion without proper base case
 - Modifying parameters thinking it affects original variables

<details>
<summary>Advanced Functions</summary>

/*
 * FUNCTION POINTERS:
 * - Syntax: return_type (*pointer_name)(parameter_types)
 * - Can be stored in arrays for dispatch tables
 * - Useful for callbacks and plugin architectures
 * - Enable dynamic function selection at runtime
 * 
 * RECURSION CONSIDERATIONS:
 * - Always have a base case to prevent infinite recursion
 * - Be aware of stack overflow with deep recursion
 * - Iterative solutions often more efficient
 * - Tail recursion optimization may help
 * 
 * VARIABLE ARGUMENTS:
 * - Use stdarg.h macros: va_start, va_arg, va_end
 * - First parameter must indicate argument count or format
 * - Type promotion rules apply (float -> double, etc.)
 * - No type checking - programmer responsibility
 * 
 * STATIC FUNCTIONS/VARIABLES:
 * - Static functions: internal linkage (file scope only)
 * - Static variables: persistent between function calls
 * - Help with encapsulation and data hiding
 * - Reduce namespace pollution

- **structures-unions** - struct definition, member access, unions, typedef, nested structures

<details>
<summary>Structures & Unions</summary>


/*
 * MEMORY LAYOUT:
 * Structures: Members stored sequentially with possible padding
 * Unions: All members share same memory location
 * Bit fields: Pack multiple flags into single bytes
 * 
 * STRUCTURE PADDING:
 * Compiler may add padding bytes for alignment
 * Use #pragma pack or __attribute__((packed)) to control
 * sizeof(struct) may be larger than sum of members
 * 
 * STRUCTURE VS UNION:
 * Structure: Each member has its own memory
 * Union: All members share same memory (size = largest member)
 * Use unions for memory efficiency when only one value needed at a time
 * 
 * BEST PRACTICES:
 * - Initialize structures to avoid garbage values
 * - Use typedef for cleaner syntax
 * - Consider alignment and padding for performance
 * - Use designated initializers for clarity
 * - Be careful with unions - track which member is active
 * 
 * COMMON PITFALLS:
 * - Forgetting to initialize structure members
 * - Assuming structure layout (padding issues)
 * - Copying structures with pointers (shallow copy)
 * - Using wrong union member
 * - Comparing structures directly (use memcmp or compare members)
 */

- **file-input-output** - fopen, fread, fwrite, file modes, error handling, text vs binary

<details>
<summary>File Input/Output</summary>

/*
 * FILE MODES REFERENCE:
 * "r"  - Read only, file must exist
 * "w"  - Write only, truncates or creates file
 * "a"  - Append, writes at end of file
 * "r+" - Read/write, file must exist
 * "w+" - Read/write, truncates or creates file
 * "a+" - Read/append, creates if doesn't exist
 * 
 * Add 'b' for binary mode: "rb", "wb", "ab", etc.
 * 
 * TEXT vs BINARY FILES:
 * Text files: Human-readable, platform-specific line endings
 * Binary files: Exact byte representation, no translation
 * 
 * FILE POSITIONING:
 * fseek(file, offset, origin) - Move file pointer
 * ftell(file) - Get current position
 * rewind(file) - Go to beginning
 * 
 * ORIGINS:
 * SEEK_SET - Beginning of file
 * SEEK_CUR - Current position
 * SEEK_END - End of file
 * 
 * ERROR HANDLING:
 * Always check return values of file operations
 * Use perror() for system error messages
 * Check ferror() and feof() for file state
 * 
 * COMMON PITFALLS:
 * - Not checking if fopen() returns NULL
 * - Forgetting to close files (resource leak)
 * - Using wrong mode for intended operation
 * - Buffer overflow with fgets()
 * - Mixing text and binary operations
 * - Not handling partial reads/writes

- **dynamic-memory** - malloc, calloc, realloc, free, memory allocation patterns

<details>
<summary>Dynamic Memory Management</summary>



/*
 * DYNAMIC MEMORY FUNCTIONS:
 * malloc(size) - Allocates uninitialized memory
 * calloc(count, size) - Allocates zero-initialized memory
 * realloc(ptr, new_size) - Resizes existing allocation
 * free(ptr) - Deallocates memory
 * 
 * MEMORY ALLOCATION BEST PRACTICES:
 * 1. Always check if allocation succeeded (ptr != NULL)
 * 2. Match every malloc/calloc/realloc with exactly one free
 * 3. Set pointers to NULL after freeing
 * 4. Don't use freed memory (use after free)
 * 5. Don't free the same pointer twice (double free)
 * 6. Don't free pointers not returned by allocation functions
 * 
 * COMMON ALLOCATION PATTERNS:
 * - RAII: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization
 * - Error handling with cleanup using goto
 * - Memory pools for performance
 * - Reference counting for shared resources
 * 
 * DEBUGGING TIPS:
 * - Use valgrind on Linux to detect memory errors
 * - Use AddressSanitizer compiler flags
 * - Initialize pointers to NULL
 * - Use static analysis tools
 * 
 * PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS:
 * - malloc/free can be expensive - consider memory pools
 * - Avoid frequent realloc calls - grow exponentially
 * - calloc may be slower than malloc for large allocations
 * - Consider alignment requirements for performance

- **pointers-introduction** - Pointer basics, address-of operator, dereferencing, pointer arithmetic

<details>
<summary>Pointers Introduction</summary>


/*
 * POINTER FUNDAMENTALS:
 * - Pointer: Variable that stores memory address
 * - & (address-of): Gets address of a variable
 * - * (dereference): Gets value at address stored in pointer
 * - NULL: Special pointer value indicating "no address"
 * 
 * POINTER ARITHMETIC:
 * - ptr++ : Move to next element (adds sizeof(type) bytes)
 * - ptr-- : Move to previous element
 * - ptr + n : Move n elements forward
 * - ptr2 - ptr1 : Number of elements between pointers
 * 
 * ARRAYS AND POINTERS:
 * - Array name is pointer to first element
 * - arr[i] equivalent to *(arr + i)
 * - &arr[i] equivalent to (arr + i)
 * 
 * MEMORY LAYOUT:
 * [int a][int b][int c][int d]
 *    ^     ^     ^     ^
 *   ptr   ptr+1 ptr+2 ptr+3
 * 
 * COMMON PITFALLS:
 * - Dereferencing NULL pointers (segmentation fault)
 * - Pointer arithmetic on void pointers
 * - Dangling pointers (pointing to freed memory)
 * - Buffer overruns with pointer arithmetic
 * - Forgetting to initialize pointers
 * - Confusing * in declaration vs dereferencing
 * 
 * BEST PRACTICES:
 * - Initialize pointers to NULL
 * - Check for NULL before dereferencing
 * - Set pointers to NULL after freeing memory
 * - Use const for read-only data
 * - Be careful with pointer arithmetic bounds

 * 
 * PARSING STRATEGIES:
 * 1. Manual parsing with string comparison
 * 2. getopt() library (POSIX systems)
 * 3. Third-party libraries (argparse, etc.)
 * 
 * ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
