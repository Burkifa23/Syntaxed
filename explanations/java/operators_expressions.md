### Snippet: `Operators && expressions in Java`

This snippet explores the use of Java operators to create expressions, covering arithmetic, relational, logical, and conditional operators, with a focus on how operator precedence determines the order of evaluation.

### Snippet Goal

To practice using the full range of Java operators, including compound assignment and the ternary operator, while clearly demonstrating the effect of operator precedence in complex expressions.

### Core Concepts Explained

**1. Primary Operator Groups**

* **Arithmetic:** Used for mathematical calculations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` for remainder). Integer division (`/`) truncates the decimal part.
* **Unary:** Operators that act on a single operand (`++` increment, `--` decrement, `!` logical NOT).
* **Assignment:** Used to assign values. Includes the simple assignment `=` and compound assignments like `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, which combine an arithmetic operation with assignment.
* **Relational:** Used for comparisons (`>`, `<`, `==` equals, `!=` not equals). These always result in a **`boolean`** value (`true` or `false`).
* **Logical:** Used to combine boolean expressions (`&&` AND, `||` OR, `!` NOT).

**2. Logical Short-Circuiting**

The **`&&` (AND)** and **`||` (OR)** operators are short-circuiting:

* For `&&`, if the left operand is `false`, the right operand is **never evaluated**, as the result must be `false`.
* For `||`, if the left operand is `true`, the right operand is **never evaluated**, as the result must be `true`.
* This is critical for efficiency and preventing errors (e.g., preventing a division by zero check if the condition for zero is met).

**3. The Ternary Operator (`? :`)**

The ternary (or conditional) operator is a concise way to express simple `if-else` logic in a single line. It requires three operands:

* `Condition ? ValueIfTrue : ValueIfFalse;`
* It is often used for simple conditional assignments.

**4. Operator Precedence**

Operator precedence dictates the order in which operators in an expression are evaluated. For example, multiplication (`*`) has higher precedence than addition (`+`), meaning `5 + 10 * 2` evaluates to 25, not 30.

* Unary operators (`++`, `!`) are highest.
* Arithmetic operators (`*`, `/`, `%` before `+`, `-`).
* Relational operators.
* Logical operators (`&&` before `||`).
* Assignment operators are lowest.
* Parentheses **`()`** can always be used to override default precedence and enforce a specific evaluation order.

### Syntaxed Typing Focus

This snippet tests proficiency with various operator symbols and syntactic patterns:

* **Complex Symbols:** Accurate typing of multi-character operators like `+=`, `&&`, `||`, and `? :`.
* **Short-Circuiting Code:** Practicing the correct structure for conditional checks using `&&` to ensure code safety.
* **Ternary Structure:** Typing the three-part conditional syntax.
