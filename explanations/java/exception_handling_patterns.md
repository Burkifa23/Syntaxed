### Snippet: `Exception Handling Patterns in Java`

This snippet focuses on professional **exception handling patterns**, which ensure that errors are reported clearly, logged properly, and lead to graceful application behavior rather than termination. It highlights **exception wrapping** and **recovery strategies**.

### Snippet Goal

To practice implementing **Exception Wrapping (Chaining)** to hide low-level details from the calling code, use a professional **Logger** to record exceptions, and implement a **Recovery/Fallback** mechanism to ensure the application remains stable after a minor error.

### Core Concepts Explained

**1. Exception Wrapping (Chaining)**

* **Problem Solved:** Prevents low-level, implementation-specific exceptions (like `IOException`) from leaking into high-level business logic.
* **Mechanism:** A method catches a low-level exception and throws a new, custom, high-level exception (e.g., `ConfigurationException`). The original exception is passed as the **cause** in the constructor: `throw new HighLevelException("msg", lowLevelException)`.
* **Benefit:** The caller deals with business-relevant errors (`ConfigurationException`), but can still retrieve the original stack trace via `Throwable.getCause()` for debugging.

**2. Logging Exceptions**

* **Logger Use:** Instead of just printing to `System.err`, professional applications use logging frameworks (like the built-in `java.util.logging` or external libraries like Log4j/SLF4J).
* **Stack Trace:** The correct way to log an exception is to pass the exception object itself to the logger (`LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, "message", e)`). This ensures the logger records the **full stack trace**, which is essential for diagnosis.

**3. Recovery/Fallback Pattern**

* **Mechanism:** The code surrounds a potentially failing operation with a `try-catch` block. If the operation fails, the `catch` block does not rethrow the exception; instead, it executes a **fallback strategy** (e.g., loading data from a cache, using a default value, or returning an empty collection).
* **Benefit:** Prevents application failure due to non-critical external issues (like a slow network or unavailable service), improving user experience and system stability.

### Syntaxed Typing Focus

This snippet tests proficiency in utility and structural patterns:

* **Logger Instantiation:** Typing the `Logger.getLogger(...)` pattern and using static final fields for the logger instance.
* **Logging API:** Typing `LOGGER.log(Level.LEVEL, "message", exception)` to correctly log the error with the stack trace.
* **Chaining Constructor:** Typing the custom exception constructor that accepts a `Throwable cause` and calls `super(message, cause)`.
* **Recovery Logic:** Practicing inserting a fallback return value inside the `catch` block instead of throwing a new exception.
