### Snippet: `Interfaces in Java`

This snippet introduces **interfaces**, which are the standard mechanism in Java for defining a contract or a set of behaviors that a class must adhere to. Interfaces enforce total abstraction of behavior, decoupling the definition of *what* a class does from the implementation of *how* it does it.

### Snippet Goal

To practice defining an interface using the `interface` keyword, implementing that contract in concrete classes using the `implements` keyword, and utilizing modern features like **default methods** and **interface constants**.

### Core Concepts Explained

**1. Interface Definition (The Contract)**

* An **interface** is defined using the `interface` keyword. It represents a 100% abstract class template (unlike abstract classes, which can have concrete methods).
* **Implementation:** A concrete class uses the **`implements`** keyword to adopt the interface (e.g., `class MySqlConnection implements DatabaseConnection`).
* **Rule:** A class can implement **multiple interfaces** (simulating multiple inheritance of behavior, which is prohibited for classes).

**2. Interface Members**

* **Abstract Methods:** Methods declared without a body in an interface are implicitly **`public abstract`**. All implementing classes **must** provide a concrete body for these methods.
* **Fields:** Fields declared in an interface are implicitly **`public static final`** (constants). They must be initialized at the time of declaration.

**3. Default Methods (Java 8+)**

* **Definition:** A method within an interface that includes a method body. It is declared using the **`default`** keyword.
* **Purpose:** Default methods allow interfaces to be extended with new features without breaking existing implementing classes, as classes can simply inherit the default implementation. Implementing classes can still override the default method if needed.

### Syntaxed Typing Focus

This snippet tests proficiency in crucial interface syntax:

* **Keyword Usage:** Accurately typing the `interface` and **`implements`** keywords in their respective places.
* **Constant Naming:** Practicing the standard Java convention for static final constants: **`ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES`**.
* **Default Keyword:** Correctly typing the **`default`** keyword for methods that include a body within the interface.
* **Polymorphism:** Reinforcing the ability to use the interface type as a reference for any implementing class (`DatabaseConnection db = new MySqlConnection();`).
