### Snippet: `Static in Java`

This snippet explains the **`static`** keyword, which is used to declare members that belong to the **class itself**, rather than to any specific instance (object) of the class. Static members provide class-level utility and shared state.

### Snippet Goal

To practice declaring **static fields** (variables shared across all instances), defining **static methods** (utility functions), and understanding the role of **static initialization blocks** when a class is first loaded into the JVM.

### Core Concepts Explained

**1. Static Fields (Class Variables)**

* **Ownership:** A static field is created and stored in a shared memory area when the class is loaded by the JVM. There is **only one copy** of the static field, regardless of how many objects (or zero objects) of that class are created.
* **Use Case:** Ideal for counters, global constants, configuration settings, or shared resources that all instances need to access (e.g., `ResourceTracker.totalResources`).
* **Access:** Should be accessed directly using the class name (`ResourceTracker.totalResources`). Accessing them via an object reference is discouraged.

**2. Static Methods (Utility Methods)**

* **Independence:** A static method belongs to the class and can be called directly using the class name (`ResourceTracker.getNextId()`).
* **Restriction:** A static method **cannot access instance (non-static) members** of the class because it is executed without an associated object. It can only directly access other static members or local variables.
* **Use Case:** Common for utility methods (like factory methods or helpers) that don't need to depend on the state of a specific object (e.g., `Math.random()`).

**3. Static Initialization Block**

* **Syntax:** `static { ... }`.
* **Execution:** This block of code runs **once** when the class is first loaded into memory by the JVM.
* **Use Case:** Used for complex, one-time initialization of static variables that cannot be done on a single line (e.g., loading a large configuration file or setting up a static logger).

### Syntaxed Typing Focus

This snippet tests proficiency in applying the `static` keyword correctly and following best practices:

* **Keyword Placement:** Accurately typing the **`static`** modifier in front of the data type (for fields) or the return type (for methods).
* **Access Practice:** Correctly accessing static members using the class name (`ClassName.member`).
* **Block Syntax:** Typing the `static { }` structure for the initialization block.
