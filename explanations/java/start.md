### Snippet: `Hello, World!`

This snippet introduces the absolute minimum structure required to compile and execute a Java program, establishing the core components necessary for any application.

### Snippet Goal

To practice the mandatory boilerplate code, understand the role of the `class` definition, and execute a simple output command.

### Core Concepts Explained

**1. Class Definition**

* **`public class HelloWorld`**: All Java code must be contained within a **class**. The class name (`HelloWorld`) should ideally match the file name (`HelloWorld.java`). The `public` keyword means this class is accessible from anywhere.

**2. The `main` Method (The Entry Point)**

* **`public static void main(String[] args)`**: This method serves as the **entry point** for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When you run a Java application, the JVM looks for this exact signature.
    * **`public`**: The method must be accessible by the JVM.
    * **`static`**: The method belongs to the class itself, not a specific instance (object), allowing the JVM to call it without first creating an object.
    * **`void`**: The method does not return any value.
    * **`String[] args`**: This is an array that can be used to capture command-line arguments passed to the program.

**3. Output Statement**

* **`System.out.println("Hello, Syntaxed!");`**: This command is used to display text to the standard output console.
    * **`System`**: A final class in the `java.lang` package.
    * **`out`**: A static field of type `PrintStream`.
    * **`println`**: A method that prints the given argument and then terminates the line.

**4. Execution Flow (Compile and Run)**

The Java compilation and execution process involves two main steps:

* **Compilation (`javac`):** The Java source code (`.java` file) is compiled into **bytecode** (`.class` file).
* **Execution (JVM):** The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** executes the bytecode. This abstraction layer is what enables Java's "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) philosophy.

### Syntaxed Typing Focus

This snippet focuses on accurate typing of essential, frequently used keywords and fully qualified names:

* **Mandatory Keywords:** `public`, `class`, `static`, `void`.
* **JVM Entry Point Signature:** Typing the exact `main` method signature, including the `String[] args` parameter.
* **Console Output:** Typing the full, capitalized path: `System.out.println`.
