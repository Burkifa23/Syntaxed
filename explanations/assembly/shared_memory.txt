This x86-64 assembly code attempts to demonstrate inter-process communication (IPC) using shared memory, though it uses a simplified, non-functional approach for the system calls. Shared memory is a method for two or more processes to access the same region of memory, enabling very fast communication between them.

Data and BSS Sections
.data: Defines constants for the shared memory key (12345) and size (4096 bytes).

.bss: Reserves uninitialized space for variables that will hold the shared memory ID (shm_id) and its memory address (shm_addr).

Function Breakdown
The program's main logic is divided into three functions, though only one has an actual implementation.

create_shared_memory
This function is a placeholder for the shmget() system call. In a real-world scenario, shmget() would be called to create or get a shared memory segment from the kernel, returning an identifier. This assembly code simply returns without performing the call.

attach_shared_memory
This function is a simplified replacement for the shmat() system call, which attaches a shared memory segment to the process's address space. Instead of using shmat(), this code uses the sys_brk system call to allocate a new segment of heap memory for demonstration purposes.

mov rax, 12 & mov rdi, 0 & syscall: This gets the current program break (the end of the heap) and stores it in shm_addr.

add rax, shm_size: The heap address is increased by 4096 bytes to allocate space.

mov rdi, rax & mov rax, 12 & syscall: This sets the new program break, effectively allocating the memory.

detach_shared_memory
This is a placeholder for the shmdt() system call, which detaches the shared memory segment from the process's address space.

Program Execution (_start)
call create_shared_memory: This calls the placeholder function.

call attach_shared_memory: The program allocates 4096 bytes of heap memory, and the address is stored in shm_addr.

mov rax, [shm_addr]: The address of the newly allocated memory is loaded into rax.

mov qword [rax], 0x1234567890ABCDEF: This writes a 64-bit value to the allocated memory, simulating writing to a shared memory segment.

call detach_shared_memory: This calls the placeholder function.

The program then exits with a status code of 0.
