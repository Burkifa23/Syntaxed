This x86-64 assembly code calculates the factorial of a number (in this case, 5) using a recursive function. It demonstrates how to handle the flow of control and preserve data on the stack during recursive calls.

How the Program Works
The _start section sets up the initial call to the factorial function.

mov rdi, 5: The number 5 is moved into rdi. In the Linux calling convention, rdi holds the first argument to a function.

call factorial: This instruction transfers program execution to the factorial function.

The factorial Function
This is the core of the recursive logic.

Prologue:

push rbp & mov rbp, rsp: These instructions establish a new stack frame for the function call.

push rbx: The rbx register is pushed onto the stack. In the x86-64 calling convention, rbx is a callee-saved register, meaning the called function (factorial) is responsible for saving and restoring its value. This is crucial because the function will use rbx to store a value (n) that must be preserved across recursive calls.

Base Case:

cmp rdi, 1: The argument n is compared to 1.

jle base_case: If n is less than or equal to 1, the function jumps to the base_case label. This is the termination condition for the recursion.

base_case:: mov rax, 1. The return value 1 is loaded into rax.

Recursive Step:

dec rdi: The argument is decremented to n-1. For the first call, 5 becomes 4.

call factorial: The function calls itself with the new argument. This process repeats until the base case is reached (when n is 1). Each call places a new return address on the stack.

mul rbx: After the recursive call returns, rax contains the factorial of n-1 (e.g., 4!=24). The mul instruction multiplies the value in rax by the value in rbx, which holds the original n for this level of recursion. The product (5âˆ—24=120) is stored in rax.

Epilogue:

pop rbx & pop rbp: The saved registers and the previous stack frame are restored.

ret: The function returns to the previous call in the recursion chain, with the result in rax.

The final call returns to _start, where the result (120) is moved to rdi to be used as the program's exit code. The program then terminates.
