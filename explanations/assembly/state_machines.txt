This x86-64 assembly code implements a finite state machine (FSM). A state machine is a mathematical model of computation that can be in one of a finite number of states at any given time. It transitions between these states based on a set of rules. This code uses a state transition table to manage its flow, which is a common and efficient approach for implementing state machines.

How It Works
The program cycles through a loop, reads the current state, and then calls the corresponding function from a state transition table.

state_machine_loop:

mov rax, [current_state]: The program's current state (a numerical value) is loaded into rax.

cmp rax, STATE_DONE & je state_machine_done: If the current state is STATE_DONE, the loop terminates, and the program exits.

call [state_table + rax * 8]: This is the core of the state machine logic. The program performs an indirect call to the address stored in the state_table. The address is calculated by adding rax * 8 to the base address of the table. For example, if rax is 1 (for STATE_PROCESS), the program jumps to the address stored at state_table + 8.

State Handlers (state_init, state_process, etc.):

Each state handler function contains the logic for that specific state.

state_init: This is the starting state. It checks an input_value and, if it's valid, transitions the state to STATE_PROCESS.

state_process: This state decrements the input_value. If the value reaches 0, it transitions to STATE_DONE. Otherwise, it transitions to STATE_WAIT.

state_wait: This state, in this simplified example, immediately transitions back to STATE_PROCESS. In a real-world scenario, it might wait for an external event.

The current_state variable is updated in each handler to control the next iteration of the loop.

This implementation is highly modular and flexible. You can easily add, remove, or change states and transitions without altering the main state_machine_loop.
