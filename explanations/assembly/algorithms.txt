This x86-64 assembly code implements a binary search algorithm to find a target value in a sorted array of 64-bit integers. Binary search is an efficient search algorithm that works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

How the Algorithm Works
Binary search operates on a sorted array and uses two pointers: a low pointer and a high pointer. It checks the middle element of the current search interval.

If the middle element is the target, the search is successful.

If the middle element is less than the target, the search continues in the upper half of the array.

If the middle element is greater than the target, the search continues in the lower half of the array.

This process continues until the target is found or the search interval is empty.

Code Breakdown
The _start section sets up the initial call to binary_search.

mov rdi, numbers: The base address of the array is moved to rdi.

mov rsi, 0: The low pointer, rsi, is initialized to the first index, 0.

mov rdx, array_size - 1: The high pointer, rdx, is initialized to the last index, 7.

mov rcx, [target]: The target value, 7, is moved to rcx.

binary_search Function
Loop Condition:

cmp rsi, rdx: The low pointer is compared to the high pointer.

jg not_found: If low is greater than high, the search interval is invalid, and the element is not in the array. The program jumps to not_found.

Calculate Midpoint:

mov r8, rsi & add r8, rdx: The sum of the low and high indices is calculated and stored in r8.

shr r8, 1: The sum is divided by 2 using a right shift to find the middle index.

Compare Midpoint to Target:

mov r9, [rdi + r8 * 8]: The value at the midpoint index is loaded into r9. The address is calculated using the base address (rdi), the middle index (r8), and the element size (8 bytes).

cmp r9, rcx: The value from the array (r9) is compared to the target value (rcx).

je found: If they are equal, the element is found. The program jumps to found.

jl search_right: If the element is less than the target, the program jumps to search_right.

Adjust Search Interval:

If target < midpoint:

mov rdx, r8 & dec rdx: The high pointer is updated to midpoint - 1. The program then jumps to the search_loop to continue in the left half.

If target > midpoint:

mov rsi, r8 & inc rsi: The low pointer is updated to midpoint + 1. The program then jumps to the search_loop to continue in the right half.

Results:

found: mov rax, r8: The found index is returned in rax.

not_found: mov rax, -1: A value of -1 is returned in rax to indicate that the target was not found.

The program then exits with the returned value as its status code. In this case, 7 is found at index 3, so the exit code will be 3.
