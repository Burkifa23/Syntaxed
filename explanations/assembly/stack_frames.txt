This x86-64 assembly code demonstrates function calls and stack frame management, including the use of a prologue and epilogue, local variables, and callee-saved registers. It models how a high-level language function might be translated into assembly.

_start
The program's entry point sets up the arguments and calls complex_function.

mov rdi, 10 & mov rsi, 20: The values 10 and 20 are loaded into the rdi and rsi registers, respectively, to be used as the first two arguments for the complex_function.

call complex_function: This instruction transfers program control to the complex_function and pushes the return address onto the stack.

complex_function
This function demonstrates a typical function structure.

Prologue
The prologue is responsible for setting up the function's execution environment.

push rbp: The current base pointer is pushed onto the stack, saving the caller's stack frame.

mov rbp, rsp: The stack pointer's current value is moved to the base pointer, establishing a new stack frame for complex_function.

sub rsp, 16: The stack pointer is decremented by 16 bytes to allocate space for two local variables.

push rbx, push r12, push r13: The values of these callee-saved registers are pushed onto the stack. By convention, a function that uses these registers must save them at the beginning and restore them at the end to prevent side effects on the caller's state.

Function Body
mov [rbp - 8], rdi & mov [rbp - 16], rsi: The two arguments from the caller are saved as local variables on the stack.

mov rax, [rbp - 8] & add rax, [rbp - 16]: The two local variables are added together (10 + 20), and the sum (30) is stored in rax.

mov rbx, rax: The sum (30) is saved in rbx. This value will be needed later.

mov rdi, rbx & call nested_function: The sum (30) is passed as an argument to nested_function.

add rax, rbx: The result from nested_function (60) is added to the value saved in rbx (30), and the final result (90) is stored in rax.

Epilogue
The epilogue cleans up the function's environment before returning.

pop r13, pop r12, pop rbx: The callee-saved registers are restored to their original values.

add rsp, 16: The space allocated for local variables is deallocated.

pop rbp: The caller's base pointer is restored, collapsing the stack frame.

ret: The ret instruction returns control to the caller (_start).

nested_function
mov rax, rdi: The input argument (30) is moved into rax.

shl rax, 1: The value in rax is doubled (30 * 2 = 60) using a left shift.

ret: The function returns, with the result 60 in rax.

The program then exits with a status code of 90, the final result of the calculation.
