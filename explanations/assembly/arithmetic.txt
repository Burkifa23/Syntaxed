This assembly code performs a simple addition of two 64-bit numbers and then stores the result in a variable. 

Here's a line-by-line explanation.

Data Declaration (.data section)
The .data section is where initialized data is stored.

num1 dq 15: dq (define quadword) allocates 8 bytes of memory and initializes it with the value 15.

num2 dq 7: dq allocates another 8 bytes of memory and initializes it with the value 7.

result dq 0: dq allocates 8 bytes for a variable named result, initialized to 0. This is where the sum will be stored.

Code Execution (.text section)
The _start label marks the program's entry point.

mov rax, [num1]: This instruction moves the value from the memory location num1 (which is 15) into the rax register.

add rax, [num2]: This instruction adds the value from the memory location num2 (which is 7) to the current value in rax (15). The result, 22, is stored back in rax.

mov [result], rax: This instruction moves the value from rax (which is 22) into the memory location result. The square brackets [] are crucial here, as they indicate that you're moving the value into the memory address pointed to by result, not into the result label itself.

The final lines of code handle program exit:

mov rax, 60: Sets up the sys_exit system call.

mov rdi, 0: Sets the exit code to 0, indicating successful execution.

syscall: Executes the system call to terminate the program.
