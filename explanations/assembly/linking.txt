This x86-64 assembly code demonstrates how to link to an external function from another file. The program itself is simple: it calls a function named external_function and then exits. The key is in the extern directive, which tells the assembler that this function is not defined in the current file.

Code Breakdown
section .text: This is the code segment where instructions are placed.

global _start: Makes the _start label visible to the linker, as it's the program's entry point.

extern external_function: The extern directive is a command to the assembler. It tells the assembler that external_function is a symbol (a label, or a function name) that is defined somewhere else, likely in a separate assembly or C file. The assembler will not be able to resolve its address and will leave a placeholder for the linker to fill in later.

_start:: The program's entry point.

call external_function: This instruction attempts to call the function. The assembler generates a call instruction with a placeholder for the function's address.

mov rax, 60 & mov rdi, 0 & syscall: These instructions set up and execute the sys_exit system call to terminate the program.

When you compile this code, you need to link it with the file that contains the definition of external_function. For example, if external_function is in a file named ext.asm, you would compile and link them together:

Bash

nasm -f elf64 main.asm -o main.o
nasm -f elf64 ext.asm -o ext.o
ld main.o ext.o -o my_program

The linker (ld) will then resolve the address of external_function and place it in the correct location in the final executable.
