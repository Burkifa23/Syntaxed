This x86-64 assembly code provides a simple example of a menu-driven command-line application. It demonstrates fundamental programming constructs like loops, conditional branching, and input/output operations from the perspective of an assembly language program.

Code Breakdown
The program's logic is structured around a central loop that interacts with the user.

Data and BSS Sections
section .data: This section holds initialized data, such as the text for the menu, prompts, and messages.

section .bss: This section reserves uninitialized space for variables, such as the input_buffer to temporarily store user input and num1, num2, and choice to store program data.

_start and main_loop
This is the program's main execution loop.

call print_menu: The program begins by displaying a simple menu to the user.

call get_choice: It then waits for and reads a single character from the user's input. The character is stored in the choice variable.

Conditional Branching: The code then compares the user's input character to the ASCII values for '1', '2', and '3'.

cmp al, '1', je do_addition: If the input is '1', it jumps to the do_addition routine.

Similar jumps exist for do_subtraction ('2') and exit_app ('3').

jmp main_loop: If the user's input doesn't match any of the valid options, the program jumps back to the beginning of the main_loop, effectively re-displaying the menu and asking for input again.

Helper Routines
The program is broken down into modular functions to perform specific tasks.

print_menu: Uses the sys_write system call to print the menu text to standard output (stdout).

get_choice: First prints the prompt and then uses the sys_read system call to read a single character from standard input (stdin) into the choice variable.

get_numbers: This function is a placeholder. In a real-world application, it would contain complex logic to convert user-entered ASCII numbers from the input_buffer into binary values. For simplicity, this example hardcodes 10 and 5 into num1 and num2.

print_result: Prints the "Result: " message. This is also a simplified routine; it lacks the logic to convert the final calculated number (rax) into a string of ASCII characters before printing it.

exit_app
mov rax, 60: The system call number for sys_exit is loaded into rax.

mov rdi, 0: A status code of 0 (success) is loaded into rdi.

syscall: The program terminates.

This code provides a clear, albeit simplified, example of how a console application can be built from the ground up using assembly language.
