This x86-64 assembly code defines a function named asm_add that can be called from a C program. It demonstrates how to adhere to the System V Application Binary Interface (ABI) for passing parameters and returning a value.

Code Breakdown
The program defines a single function, asm_add. The global directive makes this function visible to the C linker, while the extern directive declares that printf will be provided by an external library (libc).

asm_add:: This is the function's entry point.

push rbp & mov rbp, rsp: This is the standard function prologue that sets up a new stack frame.

mov rax, rdi: In the System V ABI for 64-bit systems, the first integer argument is passed in the rdi register. The instruction moves this value into the rax register. The rax register is used for a function's return value.

add rax, rsi: The second integer argument is passed in the rsi register. This instruction adds the value in rsi to the value already in rax. The sum is stored back in rax.

pop rbp & ret: This is the standard function epilogue that restores the stack frame and returns control to the calling C function. The ret instruction uses the return address that was automatically pushed onto the stack by the call instruction from the C code.
