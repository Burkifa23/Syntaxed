This assembly code defines two constants and a memory buffer, then loads the constants into registers before exiting.

Data Declaration (.data section)
The .data section is used to declare initialized data, but it can also be used to define symbolic constants and reserve uninitialized memory.

MAX_SIZE equ 1024: The equ directive defines a constant. MAX_SIZE is a symbolic name for the value 1024. It's a compile-time constant, not a variable stored in memory.

PI equ 314159: Similarly, this line defines a constant PI for the value 314159. This is just a numeric constant and not a floating-point number.

buffer times MAX_SIZE db 0: This line reserves a block of memory.

buffer: This is a label for the start of the memory block.

times MAX_SIZE: This tells the assembler to repeat the next instruction MAX_SIZE (1024) times.

db 0: This instruction defines a byte with the value 0.

Together, this line reserves 1024 bytes of memory and initializes each byte to 0. This is a common way to create a buffer or array.

Code Execution (.text section)
The .text section contains the program's instructions. The _start label is the entry point.

mov rax, MAX_SIZE: This instruction moves the constant value 1024 into the rax register. The assembler replaces the MAX_SIZE symbol with its value before the program is run.

mov rbx, PI: This instruction moves the constant value 314159 into the rbx register.

The final lines of code handle program exit:

mov rax, 60: Loads the system call number for sys_exit into rax.

mov rdi, 0: Loads the exit status code 0 into rdi, indicating success.

syscall: Executes the sys_exit system call, terminating the program.
