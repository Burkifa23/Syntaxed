This x86-64 assembly code demonstrates how to load the maximum possible unsigned values for different data sizes into the rax register. The program then exits.

Data Declaration (.data section)
This section defines and initializes variables of different sizes.

byte_val db 255: The db directive allocates 1 byte. The value 255 is the maximum unsigned value that can be stored in a single byte (2 
8
 −1).

word_val dw 65535: The dw directive allocates 2 bytes (a word). The value 65535 is the maximum unsigned value for a 16-bit word (2 
16
 −1).

dword_val dd 4294967295: The dd directive allocates 4 bytes (a doubleword). The value is the maximum unsigned 32-bit integer (2 
32
 −1).

qword_val dq 18446744073709551615: The dq directive allocates 8 bytes (a quadword). This is the maximum unsigned 64-bit integer (2 
64
 −1).

Code Execution (.text section)
The _start label is the entry point of the program.

mov al, [byte_val]: This instruction moves the 1-byte value from the memory address byte_val (255) into the al register, which is the lowest 8 bits of the rax register.

mov ax, [word_val]: This moves the 2-byte value from word_val (65535) into the ax register, which is the lowest 16 bits of rax. This overwrites the value previously loaded into al.

mov eax, [dword_val]: This moves the 4-byte value from dword_val into the eax register, which is the lowest 32 bits of rax. This overwrites the value in ax.

mov rax, [qword_val]: This moves the 8-byte value from qword_val into the rax register, which is the full 64-bit register. This final move overwrites all previous values, so at this point, rax holds the value 18446744073709551615.

The last two lines handle the program exit:

mov rax, 60: Sets up the sys_exit system call.

mov rdi, 0: Sets the exit code to 0, indicating successful execution.

syscall: Executes the system call to exit the program.
