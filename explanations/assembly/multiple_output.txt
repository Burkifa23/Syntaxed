This assembly code prints two separate lines of text to the console, one after the other, before the program exits.

Data Declaration (.data section)
The .data section is where the program's initialized data is stored.

msg1 db 'First line', 0xA, 0: This defines a string variable named msg1. db allocates bytes for the literal string, followed by a newline character (0xA) and a null terminator (0).

msg1_len equ $ - msg1 - 1: This defines a constant, msg1_len, to hold the length of the msg1 string, excluding the null terminator. The $ symbol represents the current memory address.

msg2 db 'Second line', 0xA, 0: This defines a second string, msg2, with its own newline and null terminator.

msg2_len equ $ - msg2 - 1: This defines a constant msg2_len for the length of the second string.

Code Execution (.text section)
The _start label is the entry point of the program.

mov rax, 1: The sys_write system call number (1) is moved into rax.

mov rdi, 1: The file descriptor for standard output (1) is moved into rdi.

mov rsi, msg1: The address of the msg1 string is moved into rsi.

mov rdx, msg1_len: The length of msg1 is moved into rdx.

syscall: This executes the sys_write call, printing "First line" to the console.

The next set of instructions is a repeat of the first, but with the second string.

mov rax, 1: The sys_write call is set up again.

mov rdi, 1: Standard output is specified again.

mov rsi, msg2: The address of the msg2 string is moved into rsi.

mov rdx, msg2_len: The length of msg2 is moved into rdx.

syscall: This executes the sys_write call, printing "Second line" to the console.

The final instructions handle the program exit.

mov rax, 60: The sys_exit system call number (60) is moved into rax.

mov rdi, 0: The exit code 0 (for success) is moved into rdi.

syscall: This executes the sys_exit call, terminating the program.
