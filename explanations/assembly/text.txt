This x86-64 assembly code adds two numbers and then exits the program with the result as the exit code. Here's a line-by-line explanation:

The .text Section
The .text section is where the program's executable instructions are stored.

global _start: This makes the _start label a global symbol, which is how the linker knows where to begin executing the program. _start is the conventional entry point for Linux programs.

The _start Label
This is the start of the program's main logic.

mov rax, 100: This instruction moves the immediate value 100 into the rax register. In x86-64, rax is a 64-bit general-purpose register often used for return values and system call numbers.

mov rbx, 200: This instruction moves the immediate value 200 into the rbx register. rbx is another 64-bit general-purpose register.

add rax, rbx: This instruction adds the value in rbx (200) to the value in rax (100). The result, 300, is stored back in the rax register.

mov rdi, rax: This instruction moves the value from rax (which is now 300) into the rdi register. For system calls, rdi holds the first argument.

Program Exit
The final lines of code handle the program's exit.

mov rax, 60: This instruction moves the value 60 into the rax register. The number 60 is the system call number for sys_exit on Linux. This prepares the system to terminate the program.

mov rdi, 0: This loads the value 0 into the rdi register. This is the first argument to the sys_exit syscall. The value 0 is the exit code, signifying that the program exited successfully.

syscall: This instruction tells the operating system to execute the system call specified by the number in rax. In this case, it calls sys_exit and uses the value in rdi (300) as the program's exit code. This means if you run this program, its return value will be 300.
