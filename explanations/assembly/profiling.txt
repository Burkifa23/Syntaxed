This x86-64 assembly code demonstrates a simple performance profiling technique using the RDTSC (Read Time-Stamp Counter) instruction. It measures the number of CPU clock cycles required to execute a loop a million times and then exits with that value as the exit code.

How It Works
The Time-Stamp Counter (TSC) is a 64-bit register in the CPU that increments with every clock cycle since the last reset. The RDTSC instruction reads the value of this counter into the rdx:rax register pair.

Get Start Time:

rdtsc: This instruction reads the current TSC value into edx:eax.

shl rdx, 32: The value in edx (the high 32 bits of the counter) is shifted left by 32 bits, placing it in the upper half of rdx.

or rax, rdx: The high 32 bits from rdx are combined with the low 32 bits from rax to form a single 64-bit value in rax.

mov [start_time], rax: The 64-bit start time is saved in memory.

Code to Profile:

mov rcx, iterations: A loop counter is set to 1,000,000.

profile_loop: This is a simple loop that performs a multiplication (mul rax) in each iteration. The multiplication is a placeholder for the code you wish to measure. The loop continues until the counter (rcx) reaches zero.

Get End Time:

The rdtsc instruction is used again to get the final TSC value, which is then combined into a 64-bit value and stored in end_time.

Calculate Elapsed Cycles:

mov rax, [end_time]: The end time is loaded into rax.

sub rax, [start_time]: The start time is subtracted from the end time. The result in rax is the number of clock cycles elapsed during the loop's execution.

Exit:

mov rdi, rax: The final result (the number of elapsed cycles) is moved into rdi.

mov rax, 60 & syscall: The program exits, returning the number of cycles as the exit code. You can view this value by running echo $? in the shell after the program finishes.

Note: The TSC value can be affected by power-saving features (dynamic frequency scaling), so the results may not be perfectly consistent across different runs or systems unless these features are disabled.
