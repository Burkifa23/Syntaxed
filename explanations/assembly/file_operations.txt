This x86-64 assembly program demonstrates basic file I/O operations in Linux: creating a file, writing content to it, and then closing it.

Data Declaration (.data section)
The .data section defines the file's name and the content to be written.

filename db 'test.txt', 0: A null-terminated string defining the filename.

content db 'Hello file!', 0xA: The string content to be written to the file, followed by a newline character.

content_len equ $ - content: A constant that holds the length of the content string.

Code Execution (.text section)
The _start label is the entry point.

Creating the File
mov rax, 2: The system call number for sys_open is loaded into rax.

mov rdi, filename: The address of the filename string is loaded into rdi, the first argument.

mov rsi, 577: The value 577 is loaded into rsi, the second argument. This is the file access mode, which is a combination of flags. The value 577 in octal is 0o1101, which corresponds to O_CREAT | O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC (create if it doesn't exist, write-only, and truncate to zero length if it already exists).

mov rdx, 644: The value 644 is loaded into rdx, the third argument. This is the file permissions (0o644 in octal, which means read/write for the owner and read-only for group and others).

syscall: This executes the sys_open system call. If successful, the kernel returns a file descriptor (a small integer identifying the opened file) in rax.

Writing to the File
mov rdi, rax: The file descriptor returned by sys_open is moved from rax into rdi. For the next system call, this will be the file to write to.

mov rax, 1: The system call number for sys_write is loaded into rax.

mov rsi, content: The address of the content string is loaded into rsi, the second argument.

mov rdx, content_len: The length of the content string is loaded into rdx, the third argument.

syscall: This executes the sys_write system call, writing the string "Hello file!" to the file.

Closing the File
mov rax, 3: The system call number for sys_close is loaded into rax.

syscall: This executes the sys_close system call using the file descriptor still in rdi, closing the file.

The program then exits gracefully. mov rax, 60 sets the sys_exit call, and mov rdi, 0 sets the exit code to 0 for success.
