This x86-64 assembly code demonstrates multithreading on a Linux system using the clone system call. The program creates a new process (a "thread" in this context), which shares its memory space with the parent, and then both the parent and child processes execute different code paths.

How It Works
The clone system call is a powerful primitive that creates a new process, but with more fine-grained control over what resources are shared with the parent. When CLONE_VM is used, the new process shares the same virtual memory space, effectively acting as a thread.

Main Thread: The main program first prints a message, "Main thread".

sys_clone: The clone system call is executed with the following arguments:

rax=56: The system call number for sys_clone.

rdi=0x00010000: This is the CLONE_VM flag. It tells the kernel to make the new process share the same virtual memory as the parent, creating a thread.

rsi=stack_top: The stack pointer for the new thread. Each thread requires its own stack to manage its function calls and local variables independently.

The other arguments (rdx, r10, r8) are set to 0 for this simple example.

Return Value and Execution Paths: The clone call returns to both the parent and the child, but with different return values:

In the child thread: clone returns 0.

In the parent thread: clone returns the Process ID (PID) of the new child.

Conditional Execution:

test rax, rax & jz thread_function: If rax is 0 (the child), the program jumps to the thread_function label.

Parent Path: The parent continues and executes the sys_wait4 system call to wait for the child thread to terminate. After the child exits, the parent then exits gracefully with an exit code of 0.

Child Path (thread_function): The child thread prints its own message, "Thread executed", and then exits with a status code of 0.

This program demonstrates the core mechanics of creating a thread in assembly by leveraging the clone system call's ability to share the address space.
