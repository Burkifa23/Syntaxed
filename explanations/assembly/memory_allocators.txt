This complex x86-64 assembly code implements a simplified memory allocator, featuring init_allocator, malloc, and free functions. It manages a fixed-size memory heap by dividing it into equally sized blocks and using a free list to keep track of available blocks.

Memory and Data Structures
.data section: Stores initialized variables.

HEAP_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE, NUM_BLOCKS: Constants defining the heap's structure.

heap_initialized: A flag to ensure the allocator is only initialized once.

.bss section: Reserves uninitialized data.

heap_start resb HEAP_SIZE: A block of 4096 bytes reserved for the custom heap.

free_list resq NUM_BLOCKS: A free list of pointers. Each entry points to the start of a free memory block within the heap.

Core Functions
init_allocator
This function is responsible for setting up the free list.

Prologue: Standard push/pop of base pointer and registers.

Check Initialization: It checks heap_initialized to see if it has been run before.

Initialization Loop: It iterates through each potential block in the heap.

It calculates the address of each block (heap_start + rcx * BLOCK_SIZE).

It stores this address in the corresponding entry of the free_list array ([free_list + rcx * 8]). Each entry is 8 bytes (* 8) because it's a 64-bit address.

malloc
This function allocates memory from the custom heap.

Prologue: Standard setup.

Find Free Block: It iterates through the free_list to find the first entry that is not 0. A 0 entry indicates that the block is currently in use.

Return Pointer: Once a free block is found, its address is moved into rax (the return value register).

Mark as Used: The corresponding entry in the free_list is set to 0 to mark the block as used.

Failure: If no free blocks are found after checking the entire list, rax is set to 0 to return a NULL pointer.

free
This function returns a block of memory to the heap.

Prologue: Standard setup.

Calculate Block Index: It takes the address to free (rdi), subtracts the heap's starting address, and then divides by BLOCK_SIZE to calculate the index of the block in the free_list.

Mark as Free: The original address of the freed block (rdi) is stored back into the calculated index of the free_list ([free_list + rax * 8]), effectively making that block available for future allocations.

The main program (_start) calls these functions to demonstrate a simple allocate-and-free cycle.
