This x86-64 assembly code demonstrates various ways to access data in memory, known as addressing modes. The program loads values from an array into the rax register using different methods before exiting.

Data Declaration (.data section)
base_array dq 10, 20, 30, 40, 50: Defines an array of five 8-byte (dq for quadword) values. The numbers are stored sequentially in memory.

scale_factor equ 8: Defines a constant for the size of each array element.

Addressing Modes (.text section)
The _start label is the program's entry point.

Direct Addressing: mov rax, [base_array]
This mode uses the label base_array as a direct memory address to access the value. It loads the first element (10) into rax.

Register Indirect Addressing: mov rbx, base_array followed by mov rax, [rbx]
The first line loads the address of base_array into the rbx register. The second line then uses the value in rbx as a pointer to access the data, also loading 10 into rax.

Register + Displacement: mov rax, [rbx + 8]
This accesses the value at the address in rbx plus a fixed offset of 8 bytes. Since rbx holds the address of the first element, this loads the second element (20) into rax.

Register + Index: mov rcx, 2 followed by mov rax, [rbx + rcx]
This mode adds a register's value (rcx) to a base address (rbx) to calculate the final address. This is often used with byte arrays. Since each element is 8 bytes, this loads the value at an offset of 2 bytes, which is part of the first element.

Register + Index * Scale: mov rax, [rbx + rcx * 8]
This is a powerful mode for accessing array elements. The index (rcx, which is 2) is multiplied by a scale factor (8, the size of a quadword), and then added to the base address (rbx). This correctly loads the third element (30) into rax.

Register + Index * Scale + Displacement: mov rax, [rbx + rcx * 8 + 16]
This is the most complex addressing mode, combining all previous components. The final address is calculated as: base_array + (2 * 8) + 16. This loads the fifth element (50) into rax.

RIP-Relative Addressing: mov rax, [rel base_array]
This is a key feature of 64-bit code for creating position-independent executables. The rel keyword tells the assembler to calculate the address of base_array relative to the current Instruction Pointer (rip). This loads the first element (10) into rax but does so in a way that allows the code to be loaded anywhere in memory without modification.

Complex Addressing: mov rsi, 1 followed by mov rax, [base_array + rsi * scale_factor + 8]
This shows a combination of a base label (base_array), a register index (rsi), a scale factor (scale_factor), and a displacement (8). This correctly loads the third element (30) into rax.

Program Exit
The final lines of code handle the program exit. mov rax, 60 sets the system call to sys_exit, and mov rdi, 0 sets the exit code to 0 for success. syscall then executes the call to terminate the program.
