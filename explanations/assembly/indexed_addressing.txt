This assembly code demonstrates how to access elements of a 64-bit array using register indirect addressing with a displacement. It loads the first three elements of the array into different registers before the program exits.

Data Declaration (.data section)
The .data section is for initialized data.

array dq 10, 20, 30, 40, 50: This defines a block of memory named array. The dq (define quadword) directive means it allocates 8 bytes for each of the five listed numbers. The values are stored sequentially in memory.

Code Execution (.text section)
The _start label is the entry point of the program.

mov rsi, array: This instruction loads the starting memory address of the array into the rsi register. rsi is often used as a source index register for memory operations.

mov rax, [rsi]: This loads the 8-byte value from the address pointed to by rsi into the rax register. Since rsi points to the start of the array, rax will get the first element, 10.

mov rbx, [rsi + 8]: This loads the 8-byte value from the address in rsi plus an 8-byte offset. Since each element is 8 bytes, this correctly accesses the second element, 20, and loads it into rbx.

mov rcx, [rsi + 16]: This loads the 8-byte value from the address in rsi plus a 16-byte offset. This accesses the third element, 30, and loads it into rcx.

The final lines of code handle program exit:

mov rax, 60: Sets up the sys_exit system call.

mov rdi, 0: Sets the exit code to 0 for a successful exit.

syscall: Executes the system call to exit the program.
