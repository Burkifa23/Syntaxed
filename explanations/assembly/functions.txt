This x86-64 assembly code demonstrates how to define and use a function or subroutine. It passes two numbers as arguments to a separate code block, which adds them and returns the sum to the main program before exiting.

Code Breakdown
mov rdi, 5: The value 5 is loaded into the rdi register.

mov rsi, 3: The value 3 is loaded into the rsi register.

In the x86-64 Linux calling convention, rdi and rsi are used to pass the first and second arguments to a function.

call add_numbers: The call instruction pushes the address of the next instruction onto the stack and then unconditionally jumps to the add_numbers label. This is how the flow of execution is transferred to the subroutine.

add_numbers:: This label marks the start of the subroutine.

mov rax, rdi: The first argument (5) from rdi is moved into the rax register. The rax register is conventionally used to store the return value of a function.

add rax, rsi: The second argument (3) from rsi is added to the value in rax. The result, 8, is stored back in rax.

ret: The ret (return) instruction pops the address from the stack (which was pushed by call) and jumps back to that address. Execution returns to the _start section, to the line immediately following the call.

mov rdi, rax: The return value from the function (8) is moved from rax into rdi.

mov rax, 60: Sets up the sys_exit system call.

syscall: The program exits with an exit code of 8.
