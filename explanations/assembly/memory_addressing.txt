This x86-64 assembly code adds a constant value to a number stored in memory and then saves the result. Here's a line-by-line explanation.

Data Declaration (.data section)
The .data section is for initialized data.

value dq 42: Defines an 8-byte (dq for quadword) variable named value and initializes it with the number 42.

result dq 0: Defines an 8-byte variable named result and initializes it with 0. This variable will be used to store the outcome of the calculation.

Code Execution (.text section)
The _start label is the entry point of the program.

mov rax, [value]: This instruction moves the value from the memory location value (which is 42) into the rax register.

add rax, 10: This adds the immediate value 10 to the current value in rax (42). The result, 52, is stored back in rax.

mov [result], rax: This instruction moves the value from rax (which is 52) into the memory location result. The square brackets [] indicate that the data is being moved into the memory address pointed to by result.

The final lines of code handle program exit:

mov rax, 60: Loads the system call number for sys_exit into rax.

mov rdi, 0: Loads the exit status code 0 into rdi, which indicates a successful exit.

syscall: Executes the sys_exit system call.
