This x86-64 assembly code demonstrates two common debugging techniques: using a software breakpoint (int3) and adding debug output to the program itself. This allows a developer to pause execution and inspect the program's state or trace its flow.

Software Breakpoint (int3)
int3: The int3 instruction generates a one-byte software interrupt. When a debugger like GDB is attached to the process, it intercepts this interrupt. The debugger then pauses program execution at that exact point. This allows the developer to:

Inspect the values of registers and memory.

Step through the code instruction by instruction.

Set new breakpoints.

By uncommenting the int3 instruction, you can run the program under a debugger, and it will automatically stop at that line.

Debug Output
This is a simpler, though less flexible, debugging method. It involves adding sys_write system calls to print messages to the console at key points in the code. This is useful for:

Tracing execution flow: By placing messages at different labels, you can see which code paths are being taken.

Inspecting variable values: You can add code to print the contents of registers or memory locations.

Conditional logging: The example shows how to add a conditional check (cmp rax, 42) to only print a message if a specific condition is met, which is helpful for debugging subtle bugs.

The program's output will be the "Debug checkpoint reached" message, printed twice because the condition (rax equals 42) is met. The int3 instruction would not produce any visible output without a debugger attached.
