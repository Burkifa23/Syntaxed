This x86-64 assembly code performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication on two numbers stored in memory. The final result of the multiplication is what's left in the rax register when the program exits.

Data Declaration (.data section)
The .data section is for initialized data.

num1 dq 15: Allocates 8 bytes (dq for quadword) and stores the value 15.

num2 dq 7: Allocates 8 bytes and stores the value 7.

result dq 0: Allocates 8 bytes for a variable named result, initialized to 0. This variable is used for the addition result but is overwritten by the later calculations.

Arithmetic Operations (_start label)
The _start label is the program's entry point.

mov rax, [num1]: Moves the value 15 from memory location num1 into the rax register.

add rax, [num2]: Adds the value 7 from memory location num2 to rax. rax now holds 15 + 7 = 22.

mov [result], rax: Moves the value 22 from rax into the memory location result.

mov rax, [num1]: Overwrites the previous value in rax by moving 15 back into it.

sub rax, [num2]: Subtracts the value 7 from rax. rax now holds 15 - 7 = 8.

mov rax, [num1]: Overwrites rax again with the value 15.

mov rbx, [num2]: Moves the value 7 from num2 into the rbx register.

mul rbx: This is the multiplication instruction. It multiplies the value in the rax register by the value in the operand (rbx). The 128-bit result is stored across two registers: the higher 64 bits in rdx and the lower 64 bits in rax. In this case, 15 * 7 = 105, which fits entirely within a single 64-bit register. So, rax holds 105 and rdx holds 0.

Program Exit
mov rax, 60: Sets up the sys_exit system call.

mov rdi, 0: Sets the exit code to 0, indicating successful execution.

syscall: Executes the system call to terminate the program.
