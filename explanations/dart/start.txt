Dart Hello, World!

This code snippet is the minimal, required structure for running any standalone Dart application.

void main()

This defines the primary starting function of the Dart program.

main: This function is the mandatory entry point. Dart execution always begins here.

void: This keyword specifies that the 'main' function does not return any value (it simply executes code and finishes).

print('Hello, World!');

This line executes the program's intended action.

print(): This is a built-in Dart function used to display output to the standard output device (usually the terminal or console).

'Hello, World!': This is a simple String literal being passed to the 'print' function to be displayed.

In summary, this code tells the Dart runtime: "Start here, and display this text to the user." All other application logic, including calling functions and fetching data from Supabase, will begin inside this 'main' function.
