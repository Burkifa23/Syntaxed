Dart Commenting Analysis

This code demonstrates the three primary ways to include non-executable notes (comments) in Dart code, which are crucial for documentation and maintainability.

Single-Line Comments (//)

Syntax: Start the line with two forward slashes (//).

Purpose: Used for short explanations of a single line of code or logic. Everything from the // until the end of the line is ignored by the compiler.

Example:

// This is a single line comment
print('Hello, World!'); // This is an inline comment

Multi-Line Block Comments (/* */)

Syntax: Enclose the text between /* and */.

Purpose: Used for longer explanations that span multiple lines, or to temporarily disable (comment out) blocks of code. These comments can also be nested in Dart.

Example:

/*
This is a
multi-line comment
/* nested comment */
*/

Documentation Comments (/// or /** */)

Syntax: Start the line with three forward slashes (///) or use multi-line block syntax starting with /**. The /// syntax is generally preferred for its compactness and readability.

Purpose: This is the most important type of comment for Flutter/Dart developers. It is used by the dart doc tool to generate official HTML API documentation.

Behavior: These comments are attached to the element immediately following them (like a function, class, or variable). You can use [square brackets] to link to other classes, methods, and parameters within the generated documentation.

Example:

/// Documentation comments are multi-line or single-line comments.
/// See also [MyClass] for more details.

Common Comment Patterns (TODO and FIXME)

Purpose: These patterns are conventions used by developers and IDEs for internal task tracking.

Patterns:

TODO: Marks code that needs to be finished or fully implemented later.

FIXME: Marks an area of known or suspected incorrect code that needs correction.
