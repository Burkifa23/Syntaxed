Dart Basic Data Types Explained

This covers the core built-in data types in Dart, which are essential for building any application.

Numbers (int, double, num)

Dart has two main number types, both inheriting from 'num'.

int: Represents whole numbers (integers).
Example: int age = 25;

double: Represents floating-point numbers (numbers with a decimal point).
Example: double price = 19.99;

num: A flexible type that can hold either an int or a double value.
Example:
num flexibleNumber = 10;
flexibleNumber = 10.5; // Valid reassignment

Strings (Text Data)

Strings are sequences of characters used for text data.

Declaration: Use single (') or double (") quotes.
Example: String name = 'Alice';

Multi-line Strings: Use triple quotes (''' or """) to create strings that span multiple lines.
Example:
'''This is a
multi-line string'''

String Interpolation: A powerful way to embed variable values or expressions directly within a string using the '$' symbol.

Simple variables: Use $variableName

Expressions/Calculations: Use ${expression}

Example:
int count = 5;
print('The count is $count');
print('Next count is ${count + 1}');

Booleans (bool)

Booleans represent logical truth values. They are always either true or false.

bool: Represents a binary state. Essential for conditional logic and flow control (e.g., if statements).
Example:
bool isActive = true;
bool isComplete = false;

Type Conversions (Parsing and Stringifying)

Dart is strongly typed, so you must explicitly convert between types when necessary. This is very common when reading data (which often comes in as a String) or preparing data for display.

String to Number: Use the 'parse' method on the target type.

String to int: int.parse('42')

String to double: double.parse('3.14')

Note: Use tryParse() for production code to safely handle invalid input.

Number to String: Use the '.toString()' method.

int to String: 100.toString()

double to String (with precision): 3.14159.toStringAsFixed(2) // results in "3.14"
