## Concept: JSON Serialization and Deserialization (`dart:convert`)

### Description
**JSON Serialization** is the process of converting Dart objects into JSON strings (to send to a server, like Supabase) and converting JSON strings received from a server back into Dart objects. The built-in **`dart:convert`** library handles this essential process and is the foundational pattern before using code generators like `json_serializable`.

### Code Explanation

1. **Required Import**
   The entire process relies on importing the standard library: `import 'dart:convert';`.

2. **JSON Decoding (Deserialization)**
   This is the process of taking a JSON string and turning it into a type-safe Dart object.
   * **`jsonDecode(jsonString)`**: Parses the raw JSON string into a basic Dart map (`Map<String, dynamic>`).
   * **`fromJson` Constructor**: This is the standard pattern for converting the raw Dart Map into a type-safe class instance (`UserModel`). This **factory constructor** handles the necessary type casting (`as int`, `as String`) to guarantee strong type safety for the rest of your application.

3. **JSON Encoding (Serialization)**
   This is the process of converting a Dart object back into a JSON string that can be sent over a network.
   * **`toJson()` Method**: A conventional method implemented on the Dart class that returns a `Map<String, dynamic>` representation of the object's current state.
   * **`jsonEncode(dartMap)`**: Converts the map generated by `toJson()` into a single, compliant JSON string.

4. **The Model Pattern**
   This two-part approach (`fromJson` factory for incoming data, `toJson` method for outgoing data) is the manual serialization pattern recommended by the Dart documentation for setting up robust, type-safe data models.
